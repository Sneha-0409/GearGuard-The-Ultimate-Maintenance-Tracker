### Project Status Snapshot

- Production-ready maintenance management workflow is implemented end-to-end
- Core modules delivered: Equipment, Teams, Members, and Maintenance Requests
- Views delivered: Dashboard, Kanban Board, Calendar, Equipment, and Teams
- Smart behaviors delivered: auto-fill assignment, stage transitions, scrap handling, overdue indicators, and request numbering

### First-Time Setup Flow

1. Run PowerShell setup: `./setup.ps1`
2. Configure environment in `.env` with a valid `MONGO_URI`
3. Start the app with `npm run dev`
4. Open the app and create a team, add members, register equipment, and create requests

### Quick Troubleshooting

- Database issues: verify MongoDB availability and `.env` values
- Port conflicts: change `PORT` in `.env` or stop conflicting processes
- SSO issues: verify your Google and Microsoft Client IDs and Secrets are set in `.env` and callback URIs match exactly.
- Dependency issues: reinstall packages after clearing `node_modules`
- For full production troubleshooting and hardening, see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
